# About
My name is Jake Walker, and I [spent the last decade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-walker-2b100b19/) as a PM at Google Research and Google DeepMind primarily working on audio AI projects, a role I left in early 2025.

I wrote this document in an attempt to capture any knowlege I have accrued before it is lost to the void. I'm posting it publicly in the hope that someone out there who wants to learn about audio will stumble across it and find it a more gentle introduction than I was able to find when I was starting out.  Any errors, omissions, or opinions expressed are my own.
