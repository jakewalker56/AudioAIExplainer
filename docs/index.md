## About the author
Jake Walker spent a decade as a PM in Google Research and Google DeepMind primarily working on audio AI projects. He left that role in early 2025 and wrote this set of documents in an attempt to capture the knowlege he had accrued before it faded into the void.  He has posted it publicly in the hopes that some future aspiring audio PM may have a less tumultuous path than he did to acquire this knowledge.
